# Code-Refactor

http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html

## Project description: 
To refactor html and css into a more concise and semantic styling along with adding accessibility attributes to reach a wider audience and improve compliance. Completed by assigning semantic elements in standardized fashion and adding alt tags to images.

## Why bother with accessibility ?
    Because inclusivity affects us all, and a more accessible webpage benefits everyone by improving search engine results and site rating.
